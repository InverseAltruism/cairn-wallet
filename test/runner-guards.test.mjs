// The runner IS the gate: every suite in this fund-custody repo reaches CI only through test/run.mjs.
// Its aggregation invariant ("a mid-suite failure still runs the rest AND forces a non-zero exit") was
// proven only by ephemeral commit-message mutations, never by a checked-in fixture. That is the exact
// dead-green class the campaign keeps re-finding (a runner that silently stops aggregating hides every
// test behind the first red one). This ports cairn's runner-guards.test.mjs pattern to the wallet and
// adds the middle-fails fixture cairn lacks.
//
// Each case drives the REAL runner (a child `node test/run.mjs`) against a throwaway sandbox, so it
// exercises the shipped control flow, not a re-implementation of it.
